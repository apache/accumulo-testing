Usage: cingest <application>

Available applications:

    createtable   Creates Accumulo table for continous ingest
    ingest        Inserts data into Accumulo that will form random graph.
    walk          Randomly walks the graph using a scanner
    batchwalk     Randomly walks the graph using a batch scanner
    scan          Scans the graph
    verify        Verifies continous ingest test. Stop ingest before running.
    moru          Streses Accumulo by reading and writing to the ingest table.
                  Stop ingest before running.
