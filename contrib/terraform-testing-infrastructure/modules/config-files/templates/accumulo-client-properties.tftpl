## Accumulo client configuration
################################

## NOTE - All properties that have a default are set with it. Properties that
## are uncommented must be set by the user.

## Instance properties
## --------------
## Name of Accumulo instance to connect to
instance.name=${accumulo_instance_name}

## Zookeeper connection information for Accumulo instance
instance.zookeepers=${manager_ip}:2181

## Zookeeper session timeout
#instance.zookeepers.timeout=30s


## Authentication properties
## --------------
## Authentication method (i.e password, kerberos, PasswordToken, KerberosToken, etc)
auth.type=password

## Accumulo principal/username for chosen authentication method
auth.principal=root

## Authentication token (ex. mypassword, /path/to/keytab)
auth.token=${accumulo_root_password}


## Batch Writer properties
## --------------
## The durability used to write to the write-ahead log. Legal values are: none, which skips the write-ahead log; log, which sends the data to the write-ahead log, but does nothing to make it durable; flush, which pushes data to the file system; and sync, which ensures the data is written to disk. Setting this property will change the durability for the BatchWriter session. A value of "default" will use the table's durability setting.
#batch.writer.durability=default

## Max amount of time (in seconds) to hold data in memory before flushing it
#batch.writer.latency.max=120s

## Max memory (in bytes) to batch before writing
#batch.writer.memory.max=50M

## Maximum number of threads to use for writing data to tablet servers.
#batch.writer.threads.max=3

## Max amount of time (in seconds) an unresponsive server will be re-tried. An exception is thrown when this timeout is exceeded. Set to zero for no timeout.
#batch.writer.timeout.max=0


## Batch Scanner properties
## --------------
## Number of concurrent query threads to spawn for querying
#batch.scanner.num.query.threads=3


## Scanner properties
## --------------
## Number of key/value pairs that will be fetched at time from tablet server
#scanner.batch.size=1000


## SSL properties

#ssl.enabled=false

## Password used to encrypt keystore
#ssl.keystore.password=

## Path to SSL keystore file
#ssl.keystore.path=
