# The following are used by the accumulo-cluster script to determine how many servers

# If the environment variable NUM_TSERVERS is set when running accumulo_cluster
# then its value will override what is set in this file for tservers_per_host. Likewise if
# NUM_SSERVERS is set then it will override sservers_per_host.
